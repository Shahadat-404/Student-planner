      <h2>Assingments</h2>
      <p>
        Assignments are essential in helping students develop task management
        skills and maintain punctuality. By working on assignments, students
        learn to prioritize tasks, set deadlines, and manage their time
        effectively. Completing assignments on time teaches discipline and
        responsibility, preparing students for real-world challenges where
        meeting deadlines and staying organized are crucial for success.

      <h2>Uploading Resources</h2>
      <p>
        Using resources like notes, tables, and study materials helps students
        stay organized and efficient. Well-structured notes capture key
        information, tables present data clearly, and study tools like
        flashcards break down complex concepts. This systematic approach reduces
        stress, keeps students on track, and leads to better academic
        performance and higher grades.
